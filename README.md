# NZM - An Online Store for Used Apparel

<a href="nzm.netlify.app">Go to Page</a>

## Description
A simple e-commerce project with basic functionalities such as ability to view product, add items to cart, checkout selected items and an order confirmed page for successful purchase. React Router was used to add navigation to header tabs.
	
	
This project was created in the hopes of increasing my knowledge of the React library and increasing confidence in coding. While I have managed to achieve this goal, the project, in my opinion is not there yet as a presentable application but as I create other projects, I am hoping to gain more experience to be able to improve this one.

## Technologies Used
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
## Expected Features
- Responsiveness
- Routing
- Home Page (for all of the items)
- Product Page
	- detailed product descrition
	- call to action button (add to cart)
	- additional images
- Cart Page
	- summary of selected products to purchase
	- price subtotal
- Checkout Page
	- quantity of checked out items
	- ability to add a discount code
	- calculations for subtotal, taxes and shipping
	- Success Page (Order Confirmed)

## Additional Features in the Future
- Improved Home Page with a Main Banner of a larger image
- Pop-up message when an item is added to cart
- Ability to zoom out images
- Tax rates per zipcode
- randomized order number
- more robust and eye pleasing design
- tests

## Things I Learned While Building This Project
- Project Organization and decomposition of larger components into sizeable and specific chunks
- Efficiently passing down data from parent to child, child to parent and to sibling components
- Changing styles of elements from different components on click
- increased CSS and media queries knowledge
- As a lousy reader who would only glance through articles to pick up little details, I've also learned how to thoroughly read documentations of public libraries and APIs.
