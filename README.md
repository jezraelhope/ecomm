# NZM - An Online Store for Used Apparel

## Description
A simple e-commerce project with basic functionalities such as ability to view product, add items to cart, checkout selected items and an order confirmed page for successful purchase. React Router was used to add navigation to header tabs.
	
I have thought of using fakestore API in the project but I think that the items there varies so much that it would make the project incohesive that's why I chose to use my own clothing as the products since I hope to add my own personality in it and I think they add a little glimpse of me as a person.
	
This project was created in hopes to increase my knowledge of the React library and increase confidence in coding. While I have managed to achieve this goal, the project in my opinion is still not there yet as a presentable application but as I create other projects, I am hoping to gain more experience to be able to improve this one.

## Things I Learned While Building This Project
	- Project Organization and decomposition of larger components into sizeable and specific chunks
	- Efficiently passing down data from parent to child, child to parent and to sibling components
	- Changing styles of elements from different components on click
	- increase CSS and media queries knowledge
	- As a lousy reader who would only glance through articles to pick up little details, I've also learned how to thoroughly read documentations of public libraries and APIs.
